# KnapsackSolver
Academic Project – A C# implementation of the 0-1 Knapsack Problem.

This repository demonstrates two fundamental approaches for solving small instances of the knapsack problem:

	Brute-Force: Exhaustive search over all possible item combinations to verify optimality.
	Simulated Annealing: A heuristic method for efficiently finding high-quality solutions.

Features
	1. Random instance generator (item weights and values in the range 1–50, knapsack capacity = 100)
	2. Execution time measurement and solution quality reporting
	3. Configurable Simulated Annealing parameters (initial/final temperature, cooling rate, max FES)
	4. Easy extension to additional heuristics (Random Search, Tabu Search, etc.)

Getting Started
	1. Clone this repository
	2. Open the solution as a Console Application in Visual Studio
	3. Build and run to view algorithm outputs in the console

This project was developed as part of a semester assignment for an Algorithms and Heuristics course.
